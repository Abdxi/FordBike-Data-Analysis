# Ford GoBike Data Exploration

## Dataset

In this project we choose FordGobike dataset.
our dataset contains more than 13 thousand rows and 16 attributes of bike sharing system like trip duration, station name et.. As shown in the above cell we can see that the structure of the dataset need some modifications, the time need to be converted to datetime, also build a new column for age that can be got from birth year

## Summary of Findings

In this investigation, i was interested in understanding the behavioural differences between men and women, i foucsed on the age, trip duration and trip period as the most related features to my investigation.
I started by looking at the number of each gender that use the service and found thatthe number of men are higher than women which is expected because of the high physical strength required for such activity.

I also found that the range of people that use the service are between late twenties and early thirties this indicated that the service is used for reach destination (e.g. go to work) not for sport activity, this insight is tested and verdied by looking at the day period and duration distibutions.

We search deeper for more relation between gender and age to find out that men are doniate over all ages.
This finding throw us to another question which say are this domination of men over women indicates that women don't have the ability to do this kind of hard stuff? and interstingly we found that many women have rides that exceed duration of 13 hours, this indicates that gender is not a barrier to doing activities that require high stamina or physical strength.
We also found that age is play a big role in ride a bike for a long period which is expected and found that the range of age for women that take a ling ride is less than the range of men.

Finally we found an intersting insight that Preferable Day period for females with age over 24 is morning while females under 24 perfere riding in afternoon. also males seem to prefere afternoon and morning over night.



## Key Insights for Presentation

In our presentation we choose the insights that deliver a good distinction between men and women.
From this point of view we show the difference between numebr of men and women that ride bikes, also we show the insight that indicates the women ability to do hard activities.
for the last insight we show how age for men and women affects their ability to go for long rides.
